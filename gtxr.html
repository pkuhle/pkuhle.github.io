							<h2>About GTXR</h2>
                            <p>
								Georgia Tech Experimental Rocketry (GTXR) aims to become the first collegiate rocketry team to send a solid-fuel, two stage rocket to the edge of space 100 km above the surface of the earth.
								The club is entirely student-led, developing everything for the rocket such as the airframe, motor, and the electronics.
							</p>
							<h2>My Role</h2>
							<p>
								I am an avionics engineer on GTXR's flight computer team, meaning that I help develop the electronics we use on our custom flight computer. I'm sort of an anomaly in GTXR; I only really joined the avionics team at the start of my senior year of college 
								after my first internship at Gecko Robotics. Gecko exposed me to the world of embedded systems, and I wanted to pursue this further through GTXR. 
							</p>
							<p>
								As part of GTXR, I designed the version 1.0 of our attitude determination and control system (ADCS) board. This board implemented a bunch of sensors and a GPS for use in a Kalman filter to determine rocket states in flight. I actually designed this board in just a few short days since we were on a tight schedule and couldn't risk falling behind.
								The board actually ended up working once we assembled and tested it. However, we soon developed  v2.0 when, during testing, we shorted v1.0 and killed it.
							</p>
							<p>
								I've also written some software for our telemetry system in GTXR. When we were in Mojave, CA for launch in 2024, we were still scrambling to write some last minute software for the rocket. Due to being away at my internship, I was out of the loop on the software side of things; the people in Atlanta over the summer had been hard at work on the software.
								When I showed up to the desert, I had to write a packet decoder in Python for live telemetry visualization. The only catch was that I had to familiarize myself with all the work that had been done over the summer and write this decoder in under 24 hours. It was really satisfying to see it work in the end!
							</p>
							<p>
								The v1.0 ADCS board and the packet decoder are the two biggest things I've contributed to the team. However, since I am an older studet with more experience than most members, most of my contributions to GTXR are more mentorship focused. I do technical consultation like schematic and layout/routing reviews, and I 
								help with project planning and keeping the avionics team on track. I also teach new members skills like how to read electrical datasheets and how to use Altium (PCB design software). Although I do step in sometimes to do technical work in a pinch (i.e. during a time crunch where stuff needs to get done fast), I like to give younger students the chance to build their skillsets; my resume and portfolio are more estabilished simply because I have more experience, and I don't want to take learning opportunies away from them.
								It's been really fun to encourage younger members get excited about electronics. I also enjoy mentoring younger members about non-technical things like how to live a balanced life at a rigerous school!
